Thank you for participating our workshop! Read below if you are interested to continue with the project on your own.

What you could continue with:

* Facebook/Google authentication using Devise

* Editing and deleting comments inline under post

* Permission checks (editing and deleting your own stuff only)

* Cleaning out all routes and controller methods that are not used

* Creating categories (for posts, belongs_to)

* Style additional views or change the whole UI of the app
